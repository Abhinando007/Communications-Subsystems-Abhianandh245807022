#AI PROMPTS USED

1) power calibration implement a receiver to recover bitstreams from rx.npy
2) correct signal/noise power calibration
3) can u make a curve plot for BER
3) rectify all the indentation error and syntex
4) in 0db,5db,10db,15db there are three samples in each.... do according to that
5)implement RS(15,11) & Viterbi decoding
6) where does the recovered file gets saved
7) add to explicitly save them in folder feature in previous code
8) can u generate a output model image for doppler_2000Hz and snr 10db
9) doppler frequency compensation before constellation and after  constellation as a line graph
10) add the needful so that .I can achieve the required insight which is frequency offset estimation and correction
11) I have metadata(json file) and rx(npy file) downloaded

implement a receiver to recover bitstreams from rx.npy.

Save decoded results in the same directory as: decoded_bits.npyÂ 

Run the evaluation script to generate BER/FER metrics.
12) replace commpy module and add a alternative module
